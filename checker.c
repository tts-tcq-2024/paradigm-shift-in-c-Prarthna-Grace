It seems like your code is incomplete. To complete the function, you need to close the conditional blocks and ensure that the logic checks all conditions appropriately. Here’s how the complete code might look:

c

int batteryIsOk(float temperature, float soc, float chargeRate) {
  int flag = 0; // flag to indicate if any parameter is out of range
  
  if (temperature < 0 || temperature > 45) {
    printf("Temperature out of range!\n");
    flag = 1;
  }
  
  if (soc < 20 || soc > 80) {
    printf("State of Charge out of range!\n");
    flag = 1;
  }
  
  if (chargeRate > 0.8) {
    printf("Charge Rate out of range!\n");
    flag = 1;
  }
  
  return flag;
}

In this code:

    The flag variable is used to track whether any parameter is out of range.
    Each condition is checked separately, and if any condition fails, a message is printed, and flag is set to 1.
    The function returns 1 if any parameter is out of range, otherwise it returns 0.

To minimize the code complexity, you can streamline the checks and reduce redundancy by using a single return statement. Here’s a more concise version of your function:

c

int batteryIsOk(float temperature, float soc, float chargeRate) {
  int isOk = 1;
  
  if (temperature < 0 || temperature > 45) {
    printf("Temperature out of range!\n");
    isOk = 0;
  }
  
  if (soc < 20 || soc > 80) {
    printf("State of Charge out of range!\n");
    isOk = 0;
  }
  
  if (chargeRate > 0.8) {
    printf("Charge Rate out of range!\n");
    isOk = 0;
  }
  
  return isOk;
}

In this version:

    The isOk variable is initialized to 1 (indicating all parameters are within range).
    If any condition fails, isOk is set to 0 and a corresponding message is printed.
    The function returns isOk, which will be 1 if all parameters are within range, or 0 if any parameter is out of range.

This approach reduces code complexity by avoiding multiple return statements and making the logic flow straightforward.

Cyclomatic complexity (CCN) is reduced by minimizing the number of decision points (like if statements) in the code. One way to reduce the CCN value is to combine the conditions or reduce the number of branching paths. Here’s an optimized version of the code:

c

int batteryIsOk(float temperature, float soc, float chargeRate) {
  int isOk = 1;
  
  if (temperature < 0 || temperature > 45 || soc < 20 || soc > 80 || chargeRate > 0.8) {
    if (temperature < 0 || temperature > 45) {
      printf("Temperature out of range!\n");
    }
    if (soc < 20 || soc > 80) {
      printf("State of Charge out of range!\n");
    }
    if (chargeRate > 0.8) {
      printf("Charge Rate out of range!\n");
    }
    isOk = 0;
  }
  
  return isOk;
}

Explanation:

    Combined conditions: All conditions are combined into a single if statement, reducing the number of decision points. This reduces the CCN.
    Nested checks for messages: If any parameter is out of range, detailed messages are printed within the same branch, avoiding multiple top-level if statements.

This structure maintains clarity while minimizing CCN by reducing the number of decision points.

To truly reduce the cyclomatic complexity (CCN) of the code, we can refactor it in a way that avoids multiple if statements by using an array or by returning immediately when a condition is not met. Here's one way to achieve that:

c

int batteryIsOk(float temperature, float soc, float chargeRate) {
    if (temperature < 0 || temperature > 45) {
        printf("Temperature out of range!\n");
        return 0;
    }
    if (soc < 20 || soc > 80) {
        printf("State of Charge out of range!\n");
        return 0;
    }
    if (chargeRate > 0.8) {
        printf("Charge Rate out of range!\n");
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}

Key Changes:

    Early Returns: Each condition is checked, and if it fails, a message is printed, and the function returns immediately. This reduces the need for multiple if branches and flag variables.
    CCN Reduction: By returning early, you ensure that once a condition

To reduce the Cyclomatic Complexity Number (CCN) further, you can eliminate branching entirely by using a table-driven approach. This approach stores the conditions and corresponding error messages in arrays, then iterates through them. Here’s how you can do it:

c

#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    float value;
    int isOutOfRange;
    const char* message;
} BatteryParameter;

int batteryIsOk(float temperature, float soc, float chargeRate) {
    BatteryParameter parameters[] = {
        {temperature, (temperature < 0 || temperature > 45), "Temperature out of range!\n"},
        {soc, (soc < 20 || soc > 80), "State of Charge out of range!\n"},
        {chargeRate, (chargeRate > 0.8), "Charge Rate out of range!\n"}
    };

    int isOk = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (parameters[i].isOutOfRange) {
            printf("%s", parameters[i].message);
            isOk = 0;
        }
    }

    return isOk;
}
int main() {
  assert(batteryIsOk(25, 70, 0.7));
  assert(!batteryIsOk(50, 85, 0));
}
